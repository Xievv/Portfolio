# C# Section

## Preface

This class was one of my three introduction to programming courses (I took Python, Java, and C#).  Please keep in mind that everything was at different part of my learning, so the code may not be the greatest - I am still learning.  All these programs were created using Visual Studio.  Thank you!

## Assignment Generator

Our professor for this course would give us assignments on blackboard.  The objective for this particular assignment was to create a C# program that would make a sort of mock class, in which we would create the assignment for the week.  Rather than just printing everything to the console, I wanted to go a step above and try out making a program that would generate HTML to look identical to the code he used on blackboard.  It was a good start for me to learn how to write code that would write more code.  I took a weird approach, but being new to programming, it is all that made sense at the time.

## Poem Finder

Our assignments were very loose on what we had to do.  Usually material was presented in class, and we would just submit work using whatever we learned for the week.  This assignment was a product of whatever that particular week was.  Unfortuantely I cannot recall what the material of that week was, but I believe it might have been reading and writing files.  I just remember being excited that what we had learned had given me just enough knowledge to create a program that would search a text file.  A few weeks later, I dabbled in regular expression and wished I had just done that instead, but this was pretty cool for how early on the class was!

## Final Project

This was our final project for the class.  I don't recall the exact requirements of the assignment, but I do remember that nested classes was a must.  We had to make a section of the program that would print out some recipes, and another section that would present all the algorithms we created in class.  I created a utility class for anything that I felt was going to be used a lot.  I remember really enjoying how this project came out, just because of how the program came together.
