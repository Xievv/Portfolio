                              ~ [Bubble Sort] ~

         This algorithm is going to create an array of numbers, and each
  array slot will be filled with numbers randomly from 1,000 to 10,000. We will
   then sort the array from highest to lowest using a bubble sorting algorithm.
      The input array of random numbers and sorted array will be output into
    separate text files for viewing. The file path will be given to you below.
