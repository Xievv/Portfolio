                           ~ [Euclidean Algorithm] ~

         This algorithm is going to take two numbers from you and find
    out what the greatest common denominator (GCD) is between them. It will
  also be checking to see if there is either no GCD between these numbers or
                warn you that one of the numbers may be prime.
