        <td>This week we will be working with inheritance in Java.  Inheritance is an important part of object-oriented programming and you will very likely be utilizing it in the future if you get into software development.  You have learned how methods can interact with each other, now it is time to learn how classes can also.  The concept may be a little difficult to understand at first, so open up a playground file in netbeans and start messing around with code from the reading material and create something yourself!  Be creative.<br /></td>

        <td>Inheritance is a tricky topic.  It requires practice to begin seeing how you can use it.  Write some code based off the reading material, but keep it original.  Don't just copy and paste the code; Manipulate it, comment why you think it works, and explain it to me.  You are only going to grasp this if you mess around.<br /></td>
