[Summary] On this assignment, we have to create an assignment for a classroom using Java and 
have it work with printing out into the Netbeans IDE.  Instead, I decided to grab the HTML code 
that my professor had on Blackboard, change it up a little bit into a template, and generate 
an HTML file that displayed classroom assignments in a generated HTML file.

***It is over commented as required for the assignment***

AssignmentGenerator.java:  Holds the main class.

UserInterface.java:  Code to manipulating the HTML template and generating HTML code.

GenerateHTML.java:  Creates array of HTML template, makes HTML hyperlinks, and creates HTML file.

template.txt:  Template used to generate HTML

assignments.html:  The generated HTML assignment for my homework.
