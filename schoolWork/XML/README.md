# XML Section

## Overview

I took this class with extremely little experience in HTML/CSS/Javascript, so I apologize for how organized any of that structure might be.  It was a learn as you go kind of thing.  The class itself was fun, since I really did not have any idea what XML was used for previous to this course.

There is not too much to say about this section.  The last three assignments given to us were called **P01**, **P02**, and **P03**.

**P01** was using XSL, and trying to find out how to sort it in three different ways: Name, Party and State.

**P02** was using the same XML file, but using xquery.

**P03** was using XML DOM, which I now realize that I took the hard way of doing this assignment and overcomplicated everything.  That being said, I painfully learned how to navigate nodes.
