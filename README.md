# Portfolio
Date Started: November 29th, 2015
Last README Update: May 18th, 2016

Welcome to my programming portfolio.  My name is Shawn, and I am a computer science student at Manchester Community College, hoping to transfer to University of New Hampshire Durham for the 2016 fall semester.  I will have readme's in each folder to explain what my work is, and at what time it was written.

##Here are some quick details of my portfolio:

My [C# school work](https://github.com/Xievv/Portfolio/tree/master/schoolWork/CSharp) and [Java school work](https://github.com/Xievv/Portfolio/tree/master/schoolWork/Java) were for introductory to programming courses.  I decided to take both languages at the same time to get a better understanding on how to port my code between the two.  Doing this allowed me to quickly build a habbit of not being afraid to adapting to a different language.

The [database management section](https://github.com/Xievv/Portfolio/tree/master/schoolWork/DatabaseManagement) is a little strange looking.  The only part added is my scripts submitted for the final project.

[XML section](https://github.com/Xievv/Portfolio/tree/master/schoolWork/XML) contains the last 3 assignments given to us.

[Daily Programmer](https://github.com/Xievv/Portfolio/tree/master/dailyProgrammer) was made for challenges given from reddit.  Unfortunately, I only ended up adding one script to it, since I started dedicated more of my time to projects, rather than problem solving.  I intend to get back to these in the future!

[My Projects](https://github.com/Xievv/Portfolio/tree/master/MyProjects) has three applications in it.  A chat server, chat client, and weather application.  The weather application had to be temporarily abandoned since it was during my school semester when I was doing my C# and Java courses.  The chat application was actually fully functional, until I decided to add the ability to select the IP of which you wanted to connect to from the client.  I started this project during winter break, but had to stop for spring semester.  I plan to fix it for my summer vacation.
